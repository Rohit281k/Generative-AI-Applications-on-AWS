In this, you work with a Jupyter notebook to implement zero-shot prompting techniques, where you describe the desired task to the language model in plain language without providing specific examples. The model then uses its pre-trained knowledge to generate appropriate responses based solely on the provided prompt. You also create effective prompts, invoke the model, and generate both complete and streaming text outputs.
